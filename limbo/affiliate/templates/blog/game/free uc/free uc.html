          <h2 style="padding-left:3px; border-left: 2px solid red; font-weight: 500;"> How to get free UC in PUBG mobile?</h2>
          <p>This is a very easy trick that you can redeem up to 100 UC per week if you are a good player you can easily redeem 100 UC per week, this is my grant. You should not waste your time by visiting fake the website for that free UC. </p>
          <p>You can redeem 100 UC per week by playing a bonus challenge. You need a bonus challenge voucher for playing a bonus challenge. From the PUBG, you get 1 to 4 bonus challenge vouchers for free every week.</p>
          <h3 style="padding-left:3px; border-left: 2px solid red; font-weight: 500;">Free bonus challenge voucher</h3>
          <p>You can get a bonus challenge voucher for free in two ways. <b>First</b>, you collect the battle coin by watching the video, after that, you can replace that battle coin with a bonus challenge voucher. The <b>second</b> is an easy way in which you don't have to do anything, you get 1 to 4 bonus vouchers every week according to your tier.</p>
          <p><b>Where to collect a bonus challenge vouchers?</b></p>
          <p><b>Step 1.</b> To collect a bonus challenge voucher you have to open pubg mobile, then you have to click on the event box.</p>

          <p></p>
          <p>Then you have to collect the voucher by going to the mail section of the PUBG. You will get vouchers according to your tier, In my case, I am on diamond tier, so I got 1 voucher. If you are on Ace tier then you will get 3 vouchers per week.</p>
          <p><b>What will we do after getting the bonus challenge voucher?</b></p>
          <p>With a voucher, you can play a bonus challenge in which you can win 24 to 1000 battle coins. In the bonus challenge, you can play the match in TDM or erangel map, in which you have to give 1 voucher for playing. If you win the match then you get the battle coins.</p>
          <p>If you collect 1000 Battle Coins, then you can easily redeem 100 UC. Just go to the Redeem section and redeem 100 UC. </p>
